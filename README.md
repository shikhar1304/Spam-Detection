The Word2Vec notebook explores word embeddings using Gensimâ€™s pre-trained word2vec-google-news-300 model. It demonstrates how to load, manipulate, and analyze word vectors to understand relationships between words. The implementation includes similarity computations and hands-on exploration of embeddings, making it useful for NLP tasks such as semantic analysis and text representation. This project showcases proficiency in natural language processing and working with pre-trained machine learning models.# Spam-Detection
